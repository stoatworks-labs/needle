/*
 * Stoatworks Labs - About window data for Needle.
 *
 * PROVISIONAL, hand-written in the shape stoatworks-backend/scripts/sync-about.py
 * generates. Needle is not yet registered in the website's projects.json, so the
 * sync cannot produce this file; once it is, `sync-about.py --only needle
 * --apply` overwrites this with the generated copy. The facts below are the ones
 * that registration will carry, so the parameter count -- which depends on how
 * many links are present -- does not change when it does.
 *
 * `guide` is deliberately empty: there is no user guide yet, and a link that is
 * not written is left out rather than shown as a button that opens a 404. This
 * is the same provisional arrangement graticule shipped with.
